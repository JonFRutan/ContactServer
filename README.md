# TotallyRadicale  
Contact management scripts joining together a PostgreSQL database and a Radicale server.  
Included within the project are all necessary Python requirements, which includes Radicale.  
The ultimate goal is for this to be a "batteries included" CardDAV system eventually allowing for dynamic mass imports, syncing, and JAMF exports. It's far from complete, my first and foremost goal is to curtail it to my use case, and then eventually smooth out the whole process.  

## Requirements  
- **Python**  
- **PostgreSQL**  

Python libraries will be managed using a virtual environment.  

## Setup  
In the project root type `make` and the Makefile will set up the virtual environment, install requirements, and run the database initialization script.  
Within your server you will need to create a contacts_db admin user, remember to give it privileges to your contacts database using the psql command:  
 `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA PUBLIC TO contacts_admin;`  
Fill out a local .env file with the needed database and login information.  

These setups are not yet complete, and you will run into errors using them.  
  
## Goals    
- Structure a database schema for managing users and contacts. **(Done)**   
- Take in a CSV and populate our database. **(Done)**   
- Using the local contacts table, generate a set of vCard from it. **(Done)**  
- Set up an export script to Radicale using the generated vCards.  **(Done)**  
- Create a Flask frontend for easier access to functionality and data administration.  
- Redefine setup scripts to be universal and complete.
- Redesign import system for more flexible CSV (Or other) -> Postgres.  
- Redesign export system for more powerful Radicale integration.
